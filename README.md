## DECTALK Choir
### Background
Dectalk is a text to speech synthesizer released in 1983. It was famously used by Steven Hawking, and was included in the game Moonbase Alpha to read chat messages aloud. The system allows pronunciation phonemes, even inputting specific pitches and durations. Players of Moonbase Alpha quickly realized that these could be used to sing songs. I think this is absolutely delightful, and really wanted to play with this myself. Rather than copy-paste lines of text into the game, I tracked down a standard version of DECTalk and made this.
